It has a crisp and sophisticated look, and a setting page where you can change your custom banner, link color, footer text and add custom CSS.</p><h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you will still have the original files if you make a mess. More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme is based on Moodle Serenity theme, customized by 3i Logic.</p></div></div></div>";
